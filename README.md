    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python automobile-sales-dashboard.py
    ```

## Project Structure

The script is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection**: Loading the automobile sales data from a specified source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the data for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing various analyses to extract insights from the data.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to represent the data and insights.
5. **Dashboard**: (If applicable) Setting up an interactive dashboard to display the visualizations.
